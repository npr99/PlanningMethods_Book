## Include resources on how to write about Race and Ethnicity


Here is some guidance on how to include race and ethnicity in quantitative analysis:
“Racial and ethnic terms should not be used in noun form (eg, Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, or Asians); the adjectival form is preferred (eg, Black patients, White participants, Hispanic children, or Asian women) because this follows AMA style regarding person-first language.”

I was reviewing a paper that include a variable in their model for "Whites"

"the higher-educated and the Whites are better prepared” suggested - “education and non-minority status positively influence”

The text often refers to race with terms like “Whites” and “the Whites”. It would be appropriate to change all references to “White, non-Hispanic”.

replace “the White race” with “individuals who identify as White, non-Hispanic or White, Hispanic”


The White - Replace with “White, Hispanic or Non-Hispanic”

With regards to including race and ethnicity in the analysis. In my field it is more appropriate to use the two questions (race and Hispanic) to define a variable to identify White, non-Hispanic and Hispanic. The current model will double count Hispanic individuals, as they will be included both in “The White” variable and the “Hispanic” variable. Consider creating a White, non-Hispanic variable to reduce collinearity in your model. If you do not change the model you must specify that the model is limited in that race and ethnicity are not mutually exclusive and that any time the paper refers to coefficients related to “White” that this variable also includes individuals who identify as both Hispanic and White.

Race and ethnicity composition data plays many important roles in the planning process. These data help to provide “reliable portraits of the present and past to inform and engage the public” (Berke et al., 2006, p. 143). Furthermore, race and ethnicity composition data are important for the principles that urban planners aspire to, specifically to help planners “seek social justice… and to promote racial… integration” (American Planning Association, 2016).

The US Census Bureau collects data on race and ethnicity using two separate questions. Both questions allow individuals to self-identify one or more racial groups and one ethnic group. Racial categories “reflect a social definition of race” and include white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and some other race (US Census Glossary, n.d.). Ethnicity includes Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino, which “refers to a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race” (US Census Glossary, n.d.). The US Census Bureau has collected race information since the first Census in 1790, but the definitions, wording and question format has changed across the decades. Race and ethnicity composition data can help communities understand cultural changes and social disparities.

Tables 3.3 provides a comparison of race and ethnicity composition for the United States between the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2018 1-year ACS. Table 3.3 reports the percentage of the population for each racial subgroup for both Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity options. For the United States the white alone, not Hispanic or Latino population was the largest racial-ethnic group with 64% of the population in 2010 and 60% of the population in 2018. The Hispanic population (of any race) made up 16% of the US population in 2010 and 18% of the population in 2018. The black or African American, not Hispanic or Latino population made up just over 12% of the population in 2010 and 2018. Table 3.3 shows the racial and ethnic composition of the US in both 2010 and 2018.

To better understand changes in population composition Table 3.4 takes the data in Table 3.3 to compare absolute and percent change in population by race and ethnicity groups. Table 3.4 highlights that while the white alone, not Hispanic or Latino population is the largest population subgroup the population group did not grown significantly between 2010 and 2018. By comparison, the Hispanic population (of any race) had the largest absolute change with an increase of over 9.2 million people, which was half of the 18.4 million total population increase. Population increases were also significant among black (2.6 million), Asian (3.7 million), and people that reported two or more races (2.3 million). The decrease in American Indian and Alaska Native total population from 2.9 million to 2.8 million (-130,661) people is cause for concern. The decrease suggests possible disparities, with either higher mortality or lower fertility rates, and requires further investigation. However, some of the decrease may be due to Margins of Error in the ACS survey estimates.

Table 3.4 also highlights issues with how race and ethnicity data are collected by the US Census Bureau. In 2018 there appears to be a decrease of 3 million people that self-identify as Hispanic and some other race, but a 46% increase in people that self-identify white and Hispanic. The shift in population can be explained by differences in how people report race and ethnicity on the survey forms and not an actual change in population due to fertility, mortality or migration. The differences in reporting also highlights limitations with the ACS which is filled out by less than 2% of the population. For the ACS data it is possible that the random sample simply selected more white Hispanic households or that the response rates among white Hispanic households may have been higher. Despite these limitations, Table 3.4 provides evidence for a changing society and a nation that is becoming more racial and ethnically diverse.
