# Planning Methods Jupyter Book
Jupyter Book with Planning Methods examples.

Will be moving Jupter Notebooks from the GitHub repository [npr99/PlanningMethods](https://github.com/npr99/PlanningMethods) to create a Jupyter Book.

Learning how to make a Jupyter Book:
1. Qiusheng Wu 2022 Creating an open-source book with Jupyter Book and Jupytext https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUdXs4OPR84&t=1912s
2. https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html
3. https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/publish.html

Executable Books Community. (2020). Jupyter Book (v0.10). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4539666

Helpfull examples:
22dylan. (2022). 22dylan/pyincore_seaside_jb: Seaside Jupyter book with demonstrative notebooks (v1.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6998352
https://github.com/22dylan/pyincore_seaside_jb 

Steps from Dylan:
1. setup a github repository
2. run all of the notebooks (make sure the _config.yml file has execute_notebooks: 'off')
3. save the notebooks so the output shows/isnâ€™t cleared
4. build the jupyter book
5. push the book to the github repository
6. follow the steps to publish to github.io
